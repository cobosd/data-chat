Question-Answering has the following steps, all handled by ChatVectorDBChain:

Given the chat history and new user input, determine what a standalone question would be (using GPT-3).
Given that standalone question, look up relevant documents from the vectorstore.
Pass the standalone question and relevant documents to GPT-3 to generate a final answer.
